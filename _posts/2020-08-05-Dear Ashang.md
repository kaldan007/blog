## Dear Ashang

I, your tsawo Kaldan wanted to tell you few things. Yesterday was the day that you left us three years ago. As usual, everyone in our family started contributing to recite **thardo** hundred times. Cho Wangdak explain the gist of **Thardo** to everyone and told us about those wonderful coincidence occurred during the first time our three families initiated after you passed away. If you are wondering about eve, she is doing much better. Everyone is trying their best to help her.

It was indeed tough for all us for losing you. Especially for me, it was unbelievable and hard to convince myself of your absence. It felt like a nightmare. I am pretty sure that all the Amas and eve might have felt worse for losing a son and a brother. But don't worry as they are accepting the reality gradually. About me, I have been listening to Sangye Nyanpa Rinpoche's teaching about **Chunjug** lately and helps me to accept the reality and introspect within. I totally forgot to tell you about my new job. I got a job as software developer at Esukhia. The founder is Gen Ngawang Thrinley or Tensang. He knows you as he has been in Sherabling for a while learning Tibetan Astrology and later teaching the subject. I am very happy for the job as it serves the purpose of all the hard work put by my ancestors and myself till date. We are working on exciting project which has potential to revolutionize the way in which one can learn Buddhism. I am excited to contribute more in future. It seems like my wishes are coming true. I wish you could have see me getting job.

About today, Me and some of my friends went to a slum near Gagal airport to give a lunch. The situation over there was very poor. I saw lots of suffering and felt many thing at once. When we reached there, we immediately started working as we want to serve the lunch on time. After chopping onions, I went to river bank to rest. Over there I met a guy called Jonnywalker. Even though due to financial problem he had many profession but his is actually an artist performing folk songs. He told us his story about performing at Jammu's All India Radio station. I requested him to sing while we serve food but he insisted to perform then itself. He started singing **Dama Dam Mus ti ka Landar**(It is famous folk song from Rajastan), It was too good that it took all the suffering in that area for a while. I was amazed by the power of music. After that we were back to reality. Me and one of my friend went to look around the place. I forced myself to explore the place as it is not very hard to debate about emptiness and impermanence and all, but I wanted to see their suffering. I felt gratitude to His Holiness and my ancestors for dedicating their life for us as they have suffered similar. I told them to not give up. I wish I could have told them more and motivate them but I was speechless when I was there. After serving the food, I saw the full of smiles. I felt helpless as I was wondering when will they get such lunch again. I remembered a discussion about ultimate solution of samsara being free of ignorance with Cho Wangdak. I was wondering when will they get chance to think about such things. I hope they will get the chance and take a different route in their life. I wish the same for all of us as all of us have fair share of suffering due to our ignorance. I guess I will stop here today. I will write you soon. We miss you dearly Ashang la.

With love,
Yours Tsawo Tolo
Kaldan
