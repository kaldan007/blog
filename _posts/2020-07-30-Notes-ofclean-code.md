## Chapter One: Clean Code

- elegent and efficient
- straight forward logic which disable bugs to hide
- minimal dependencies
- error handling as articulated strategy
- performace close to optimal
- reads like well written prose
- full of crips abstractions
- can be enhenced by other developer easily
- meaningful naming considered
- build with care
- no duplication

#### Cleaing up code 

- changing variable name for better understanding
- breaking up a function that is a little too large
- eliminating duplication
- clean up composite if statement

## Chapter Two: Meainingful Names

- Use intention revealing names
    - good names(intent-revealing) save time
    - if name requires a comment, then it is not intent revealing name. You better come up with better name.
    - intented names makes code more explicit
